Given a string of course requirement, parse it into a logic expression tree structure. Each node is represented by either a string or a python array. 
    Non-leaf nodes are arrays, and represent nodes for logical operators. The first element in the array is a logical operator (AND represented by '&', OR being represented by '|'), 
    the rest of the elements in the array are the children. Logical expressions should only ever be in the first element of the array. 
    Leaf nodes are strings, never arrays. Leaf node values are the course codes in the requirements. 

    return These are only allowed to be valid course codes, not any arbitrary string. 
    A valid course code is 4 uppercase/numeric characters followed by a space, then a 3 digit number and optionally 2 uppercase/numeric characters. 
    Use single quotes for strings.

    For any non course code requirements, ignore them in your output.

* The root node is 'Prerequisite', which is a logical operator node.
* The first child of the root node is '&', which is another logical operator node.
* The second child of the root node is 'Chinese EAST 230', which is a leaf node representing a course code.

```

Explanation:

* The first element in the array is the logical operator '&', which represents the conjunction (AND) operator.
* The second element in the array is 'SOCI 210', which is a non-leaf node representing a course code.
* The third element in the array is ['|', 'permission from instructor'], which is another non-leaf node representing a logical OR operator.

Note that the prerequisite requirement is a single course code, either 'SOCI 210' or 'permission from instructor', and the tree structure reflects this by having a single node representing each possible prerequisite."

Convert the following string into a structured logic expression tree: Corequisite: CCFC 515[/INST]  Sure! Here is the logic expression tree for the given string:
```
['&', 'CCFC 515']
```
Explanation:

* The input string is ""Corequisite: CCFC 515"".
* The tree representation is a single node with a single child, which is the course code ""CCFC 515"".
* The node is a leaf node, meaning it does not have any children of its own.
* The tree structure is a single level deep, with only one node.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."

Convert the following string into a structured logic expression tree: Prerequisite: MATH 133 or equivalent [/INST]  Here is the logic expression tree for the given prerequisite requirement:
```
['|', ['&', 'MATH 133'], ['&', 'equivalent']]
```
Explanation:

* The root node is a logical OR operator ('|').
* The first child of the root node is a logical AND operator ('&') followed by the course code 'MATH 133'.
* The second child of the root node is another logical AND operator ('&') followed by the term ""equivalent"".

Note: The term ""equivalent"" is a special case in the prerequisite system, as it allows for courses that are not exactly the same but are considered equivalent for the purpose of satisfying the prerequisite."

Given a string of course requirement, parse it into a logic expression tree structure. Each node is represented by either a string or a python array. 
    Non-leaf nodes are arrays, and represent nodes for logical operators. The first element in the array is a logical operator (AND represented by '&', OR being represented by '|'), 
    the rest of the elements in the array are the children. Logical expressions should only ever be in the first element of the array. 
    Leaf nodes are strings, never arrays. Leaf node values are the course codes in the requirements. 

    return These are only allowed to be valid course codes, not any arbitrary string. 
    A valid course code is 4 uppercase/numeric characters followed by a space, then a 3 digit number and optionally 2 uppercase/numeric characters. 
    Use single quotes for strings.

    For any non course code requirements, ignore them in your output.
